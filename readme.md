#  magic-card-price-grapher

A script I made to aggregate .csv files stored in S3 into one .csv file.

## Installing and Running

This project was made using Python 3.8.2

### How to run project locally

You can download or clone this repository, then navigate to this folder and run the python script. You will need your own collection of .csv files to aggregate, since this is for my personal s3 bucket :)
